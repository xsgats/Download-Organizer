# Download-Organizer
This background utility for Windows monitors your Downloads folder and automatically sorts files into categories like Images, Videos, and Documents based on extensions. It runs silently, handles name conflicts with timestamps, and registers in the Registry to launch on startup. Unzip and run the EXE once to start.
